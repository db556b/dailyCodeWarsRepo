// Duplicate Encoder

// The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.

    let word2 = word.toLowerCase().split('')
    let arr = []
    word.toLowerCase().split('').forEach(e => {
      if (word2.indexOf(e, word2.indexOf(e) + 1) === -1){
        arr.push(`(`)
      } else {arr.push(`)`)}
    })
  return arr.join('')

//   Simple Fun #79: Delete a Digit
//   Task

// Given an integer n, find the maximal number you can obtain by deleting exactly one digit of the given number.
// Example

// For n = 152, the output should be 52;

// For n = 1001, the output should be 101.

  function deleteDigit(n) {
      //convert n to string instead of number

    //for loop to loop through elements and remove the current integer
    for (let i = 0; i < n.length; i++){
    //create new copy of n (called a) to push into the array at the end of the loop- so we never alter the original value passed as argument
      let a = n.split('')
      //remove current index value
      a.splice(i,1)

//   Twice as old
//   Your function takes two arguments:

//     current father's age (years)
//     current age of his son (years)

// Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).

//   Beginner Series #1 School Paperwork
//   Your classmates asked you to copy some paperwork for them. You know that there are 'n' classmates and the paperwork has 'm' pages.

// Your task is to calculate how many blank pages do you need. If n < 0 or m < 0 return 0.
  function paperwork(n, m) {

//   Calculate BMI
//   Write function bmi that calculates body mass index (bmi = weight / height2).

//   if bmi <= 30.0 return "Overweight"
  
//   if bmi > 30 return "Obese"

// ATM
//   An ATM has banknotes of nominal values 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 dollars. You can consider that there is a large enough supply of each of these banknotes.

// You have to write the ATM's function that determines the minimal number of banknotes needed to honor a withdrawal of n dollars, with 1 <= n <= 1500.

// Return that number, or -1 if it is impossible.

// Good Luck!!!
