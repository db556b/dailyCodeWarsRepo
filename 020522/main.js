// NBA full 48 minutes average
// An NBA game runs 48 minutes (Four 12 minute quarters). Players do not typically play the full game, subbing in and out as necessary. Your job is to extrapolate a player's points per game if they played the full 48 minutes.

// Write a function that takes two arguments, ppg (points per game) and mpg (minutes per game) and returns a straight extrapolation of ppg per 48 minutes rounded to the nearest tenth. Return 0 if 0.



function pointsPer48(ppg, mpg) {
    return Math.round(ppg*48/mpg * 10)/10 || 0
   }
