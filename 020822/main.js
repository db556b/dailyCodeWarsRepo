The falling speed of petals
When it's spring Japanese cherries blossom, it's called "sakura" and it's admired a lot. The petals start to fall in late April.

Suppose that the falling speed of a petal is 5 centimeters per second (5 cm/s), and it takes 80 seconds for the petal to reach the ground from a certain branch.

Write a function that receives the speed (in cm/s) of a petal as input, and returns the time it takes for that petal to reach the ground from the same branch.

function sakuraFall(v) {
    return v > 0 ? 400 / v : 0
   }
