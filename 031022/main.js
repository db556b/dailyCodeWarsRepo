// They say that only the name is long enough to attract attention. They also said that only a simple Kata will have someone to solve it. This is a sadly story #1: Are they opposite?

// Task

// Give you two strings: s1 and s2. If they are opposite, return true; otherwise, return false. Note: The result should be a boolean value, instead of a string.

// The opposite means: All letters of the two strings are the same, but the case is opposite. you can assume that the string only contains letters or it's a empty string. Also take note of the edge case - if both strings are empty then you should return false/False.
// Examples

// isOpposite("ab","AB") should return true;
// isOpposite("aB","Ab") should return true;
// isOpposite("aBcd","AbCD") should return true;
// isOpposite("AB","Ab") should return false;
// isOpposite("","") should return false;



function isOpposite(s1,s2){
    console.log(s1,s2)
    if (!s1 || !s2 || s1.length != s2.length) return false
   for (let i = 0; i < s1.length ; i++){
     if (s1[i] === s2[i]){
       return false
     }
   }
    return true
